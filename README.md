# Moonlight Code of Conduct


Welcome!
--------

Moonlight is a place for former Sunlight Foundation employees to support each other. It’s a place for sharing life events, job opportunities, supporting each other and friendly debate.

We’re all friends here and this Slack exists because we all know the interests and passions of one another. Especially as it relates to open data and accessible tech.

The current admins are:
* Becca James
* Bob Lannon
* Caitlin Weber
* Olivia Cheng
* Kaitlin Devine
* Lindsay Young
* Miles Watkins
* Sam Handler
* Andrew Pendleton
* Alison Rowland
* Jeremy Carbaugh
* Nicko Margolies
* Paul Tagliamonte

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

We want to talk to each other constructively. That means we should assume that even when we disagree, we assume people have good intent.

New Members

If you wish to nominate someone for membership, please contact the admins (_before_ you speak to the person you wish to invite).

An admin will surface the membership request to the admin group. There will be a 72 hour grace period for people to discuss any objections that come up, but ultimately anyone in the admin group has veto power and will use it if they are concerned about violations of this code of conduct based on past behavior.


Confidentiality:
----------------

**Please keep what's said in Moonlight confidential**. Don't repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). When quoting (with consent), please be careful not to reveal the existence of Moonlight. Rather, you can refer to the quote as something that was said "in chat" or while you were talking to the quoted member.

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Message Retention:
------------------

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of Moonlight. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.


Expected Behavior
-----------
* Be friendly, patient, and considerate.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.



Harassment:
-----------

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant continues to engage in harassing behavior, the admins will warn one more time and may identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints. If the behavior does not change after these two warnings, the participant will be expelled from this Slack.
